    "description":"Izzy is a beautiful, wiggly, happy, playful and very sweet five-year-old, 50-pound, female, black and white Labrador/Pit Bull Terrier-mix looking for a loving guardian. \n \nIzzy is full of tail wags for everyone she meets. She knows the commands sit, down, shake and takes treats very gently and appreciatively from your fingers. \n\nShe is housebroken, crate-trained and wonderful on leash. She can jump high for a treat, and even tolerates being dressed in a tutu! Izzy loves people of all ages including children and gets along with other dogs with proper introduction. She has not been cat-tested.\n \nIzzy was originally rescued in Gary, Indiana, as a stray in February of 2012. She was adopted briefly, but did not get along with a territorial dog in her new home Ã¢Â€Â¦ so sadly, she was returned. She is an absolutely wonderful dog who deserves to live in a loving home to be adored and cherished. She is currently being kenneled in Union, Illinois, but dedicated rescue volunteers will drive her to you for a meet and greet!\n\nIzzy is extremely healthy, de-wormed, spayed, up-to-date on vaccines, micro-chipped, heartworm-tested and on monthly preventative. If you are interested in fostering or adopting this incredibly sweet dog, please contact Melia at melia88@comcast.net  or 708-224-1900. Her adoption fee of $200 benefits the rescued dogs of Lucky Dog Rescue.",
